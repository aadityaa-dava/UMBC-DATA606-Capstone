## Summary

I am a graduate student in the Master of Professional Studies in Data Science program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I have hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, and data analysis, and I enjoy exploring data to find meaningful patterns and insights. Along with my coursework, I currently work as a Graduate Grader at UMBC, where I assist with evaluating student work and maintaining academic standards. I am interested in analytics roles that involve data-driven decision making and real-world problem solving.
