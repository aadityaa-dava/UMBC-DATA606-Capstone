# UMBC-DATA-606-Capstone

This repository is the main workspace for my DATA 606 Capstone at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).

Everything related to the project lives here — from datasets and analysis notebooks to documentation and application code. The structure of the repository is meant to keep things organized and easy to follow as the project develops over time.

## What’s Inside

- **data/**  
  This is where all datasets used in the project are stored.

- **notebooks/**  
  Contains notebooks used for exploring the data, testing ideas, and running analyses.

- **app/**  
  Reserved for any application, dashboard, or interactive component built for the project.

- **docs/**  
  Includes written material such as reports, notes, and references related to the capstone.

- **Resume.md**  
  My professional resume written using Markdown.

This repository will continue to evolve as new work is added throughout the semester.
